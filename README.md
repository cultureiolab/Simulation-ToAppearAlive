# Simulation-ToAppearAlive

At what point do we recognize something as ‘living’ or ‘dying’? How is death visually communicated -- and can we still feel sympathy for something that isn’t alive if it appears to suffer, fade, or die? This digital looping display, created in TouchDesigner, references tropes from biological imaging and cellular life. Using a generative algorithm, it simulates a timeline of small figures that begin lively and pulsating, but gradually become warped, slowed, and eventually disappear.

What are the limits of simulation in current computational culture, and is there a time when mimicry begins to feel like reality? Mediated interfaces are increasingly ubiquitous -- we constantly interact with, and are emotionally influenced by, curated digital content. Through social media, online chats, and dating apps, we often engage with idealized, simulated versions of people and emotions. Additionally, as artificial intelligence, machine design, and robotics continue to advance, this topic becomes increasingly relevant. Some AIs are being trained to effectively show and respond to emotion better than ever before. At what point do we begin to empathize with machines, and when does simulated thought and feeling become something we perceive as ‘real’? Is there a point at which a simulated representation of life could ever be considered life itself?
